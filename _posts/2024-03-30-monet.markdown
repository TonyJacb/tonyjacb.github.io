Focusing on the characteristics of impressionism art style where the subtle nuances of the environment is 
revealed in high detail, the exhibit allows you (the audience) to reveal Monetâ€™s 
perspective on the spatial and temporal elements of imagery as you move around 
and spend time with the Haystacks of Claude Monet.
